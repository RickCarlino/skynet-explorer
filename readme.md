# I told you kids to get out of here!

 I am in the process of writing a simple knockoutJS app for a talk on January 27th.

 Feel free to poke around. Work in progress!

# What is it?

It's a GUI fronend to the [SkyNet API](http://www.skynet.im). A single page javascript application using KnockoutJS.

# Up and Running
