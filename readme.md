# Huh?

 It's a GUI frontend for the [SkyNet API](http://www.skynet.im). It's built using KnockOutJS and comes with a simple static server / backend for API interaction (SkyNet does not support CORS, as far as I know).

# Up and Running

 1. Type `node backend.js`
 2. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
 3. Profit.
